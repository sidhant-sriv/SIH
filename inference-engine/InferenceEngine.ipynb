Give me two of them.\\n- Quiet! My program\\'s on.\\nTonight on the Mel Dorado Show...\\nHis story gripped the world.\\nOil billionaire Miles Axlerod,\\nin an attempt to become the first car to\\ncircumnavigate the globe without GPS,\\nironically ran out of gas,\\nand found himself trapped in the wild.\\nFeared dead, he emerged 36 days later,\\nrunning on a fuel he distilled himself\\nfrom the natural elements!\\nSince then, he\\'s sold his oil fortune,\\nconverted himself from a gas-guzzler\\ninto an electric car\\nand has devoted his life to finding\\na renewable, clean-burning fuel.\\nNow he claims to have done it\\nwith his allinol.\\nAnd to show the world\\nwhat his new super fuel can do\\nhe\\'s created a racing competition\\nlike no other,\\ninviting the greatest champions\\nto battle in the first ever\\nWorld Grand Prix.\\nWelcome, Sir Miles Axlerod.\\nThank you, Mel. It is good to be here.\\nListen to me.\\nBig oil. It costs a fortune.\\nPollution is getting worse.\\nI mean, it\\'s a fossil fuel.\\n\"Fossil,\" as in dead dinosaurs.\\nAnd we all know\\nwhat happened to them.\\nAlternative energy is the future.\\nTrust me, Mel.\\nAfter seeing allinol in action\\nat the World Grand Prix,\\nnobody will ever go back\\nto gasoline again.\\nWhat happened to the dinosaurs, now?\\nAnd on satellite,\\na World Grand Prix competitor\\nand one of the fastest cars in the world,\\nFrancesco Bernoulli.\\nIt is an honor, Signore Dorado,\\nfor you.\\nWhy not invite Lightning McQueen?\\nOf course we invited him,\\nbut apparently after his very long\\nracing season\\nhe is taking time off to rest.\\nThe Lightning McQueen would not\\nhave a chance against Francesco.\\nI can go over 300 kilometers an hour.\\nIn miles, that is like...\\nway faster than McQueen.\\nLet\\'s go to the phones.\\nBaltimore, Maryland, you\\'re on the air.\\n- Am I on? Hello?\\n- You\\'re on. Go ahead.\\n- Hello?\\n- Go ahead.\\nLet\\'s go to Radiator Springs.\\nYou\\'re on, caller.\\nThat Italian feller\\nyou got on there\\ncan\\'t talk that way about\\nLightning McQueen.\\nHe\\'s the bestest race car\\nin the whole wide world.\\n- Uh-oh.\\n- If he is, how you say,\\n\"the bestest race car,\"\\nthen why must he rest? Huh?\\n\\'Cause he knows\\nwhat\\'s important.\\nEvery now and then he prefers\\njust to slow down, enjoy life.\\nOh! You heard it!\\nLightning McQueen prefers to be slow!\\nThis is not news to Francesco.\\nWhen I want to go to sleep,\\nI watch one of his races.\\nAfter two laps, I am out cold.\\nThat ain\\'t what I meant.\\nMcQUEEN: What\\'s going on\\nover there?\\nHe is afraid of Francesco.\\nMcQUEEN: That\\'s that\\nItalian formula car.\\n- His name is...\\n- Francesco Bernoulli.\\n- No wonder there\\'s a crowd.\\n- Why do you know his name?\\nAnd don\\'t say it like that.\\nIt\\'s three syllables, not ten.\\nWhat? He\\'s nice to look at.\\nYou know, open-wheeled and all.\\nWhat\\'s wrong with fenders?\\nI thought you liked my fenders.\\n- Let me tell you something else.\\n- Mater?\\nMcQueen could drive circles\\naround you.\\nDriving in circles is all he can-a do, no?\\nNo.\\nI mean, yes.\\nI mean, he could beat you anywhere.\\nAny time, any track.\\nMel, can we move on?\\nFrancesco needs a caller\\nwho can provide\\na little more intellectual stimulation,\\nlike a dump truck.\\nHa-ha! That shows what you know.\\nDump trucks is dumb.\\nHey! Whoa!\\nYeah, hi. This is Lightning McQueen.\\nThe Lightning McQueen, huh?\\nI don\\'t appreciate my best friend\\nbeing insulted like that.\\nMcQueen, that was your best friend?\\nOh!\\nThis is the difference\\nbetween you and Francesco.\\nFrancesco knows how good he is.\\nHe does not need to surround himself\\nwith tow trucks to prove it.\\nThose are strong words\\nfrom a car that is so fragile.\\nFragile! He calls Francesco fragile!\\nNot-a so fast, McQueen!\\n\"Not so fast.\"\\nIs that your new motto?\\nMotto?\\nThis sounds like something that needs\\nto be settled on the race course.\\nWhat do you say, Lightning McQueen?\\nWe\\'ve got room for one more racer.\\nI would love to,\\nbut my crew is off for the season, so...\\nPit stop.\\nYou know what? They just got back.\\nDeal me in, baby.\\nKa-chow! Yeah.\\nI know, I know.\\nI just got back, but we won\\'t be long.\\nNo, don\\'t worry about me.\\nI\\'ve got enough to do here.\\nMater\\'s going to have a blast, though.\\nYou\\'re bringing Mater, right?\\nYou never bring him\\nto any of your races.\\nAh.\\nJust let him sit in the pits.\\nGive him a headset.\\nCome on, it will be\\nthe thrill of a lifetime for him.\\n- Your drink, sir.\\n- Mater.\\nI didn\\'t taste it!\\nHow\\'d you like to come\\nand see the world with me?\\n- You mean it?\\n- Yeah. You got me into this thing.\\n- You\\'re coming along.\\n- All right!\\nKa-chow!\\nHa-ha!\\nHey!\\nHey, excuse me!\\nDomo arigato!\\nYeah!\\nGuido, look. Ferraris and tires.\\n- Let\\'s go!\\n- Ho-ho! Look at this.\\nOK, now, Mater, remember,\\nbest behavior.\\n- You got it, buddy. Hey, what\\'s that?\\n- Mater!\\nHey, McQueen! Over here.\\n- Lewis!\\n- Hey, man.\\n- Jeff!\\n- Hey, Lightning.\\nCan you believe this party?\\nHey.\\nYou done good. You got all the leaves.\\n- Check out that tow truck.\\n- Man, I wonder who that guy\\'s with.\\nAh... Will you guys excuse me\\njust for one little second?\\nHo-ho! Good job!\\nMater!\\nListen, this isn\\'t Radiator Springs.\\nYou\\'re just realizing that?\\nOh-ho! That jet lag really done\\na number on you.\\nMater, things are different over here.\\nWhich means maybe you should,\\nyou know, act a little different, too.\\n- Different than what?\\n- Well, just help me out here.\\nYou need help? Shoot!\\nWhy didn\\'t you say so?\\nThat\\'s what a tow truck does.\\n- Yeah, I mean...\\n- Looky there.\\nIt\\'s Mr. San Francisco.\\nI\\'ll introduce you.\\n- Mater, no!\\n- Look at me. I\\'m helping you already.\\nHey, Mr. San Francisco,\\nI\\'d like you to meet...\\nAh, Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.\\n- Nice to meet you, Francesco.\\n- Nice to meet you, too.\\nYou are very good-looking.\\nNot as good as I thought, but good.\\nExcuse me.\\nCan I get a picture with you?\\nAnything for McQueen\\'s friend.\\nMiss Sally is going to flip\\nwhen she sees this.\\nShe\\'s Lightning McQueen\\'s girlfriend.\\n- Oooh!\\n- She\\'s a big fan of yours.\\nHey, she has-a good taste.\\nMater\\'s prone to exaggeration.\\nI wouldn\\'t say she\\'s a \"big fan\".\\nYou\\'re right. She\\'s a huge fan!\\nShe goes on and on\\nabout your open wheels.\\nMentioning it once doesn\\'t qualify\\nas going on and on.\\nFrancesco is familiar\\nwith this reaction to Francesco.\\nWomen respect a car\\nthat has-a nothing to hide.\\nYeah, er...\\n- Let us have a toast.\\n- Let\\'s.\\nI dedicate my win tomorrow\\nto Miss Sally.\\nOh. Sorry.\\nI already dedicated\\nmy win tomorrow to her.\\nSo, if we both do it,\\nit\\'s really not so special.\\n- Besides, I don\\'t have a drink.\\n- I\\'ll go get you one.\\nDo you mind if I borrow a few bucks\\nfor one of them drinks?\\n- They\\'re free.\\n- Free? Shoot, what am I doing here?\\nI should probably go keep an eye\\non him. See you at the race.\\nYes, you will see Francesco,\\nbut not like this.\\nYou will see him like-a this\\nas he drives away from you.\\nHa! That\\'s cute.\\nYou had one of those made up\\nfor all the racers?\\nNo.\\nOkay.\\n- Ciao, McQueen!\\n- He is so getting beat tomorrow!\\nLadies and gentlecars,\\nSir Miles Axlerod.\\nIt is my absolute honor\\nto introduce to you\\nthe competitors in the first ever\\nWorld Grand Prix.\\nFrom Brazil, Number 8...\\n- Oh, hello.\\n- Hello.\\nA Volkswagen Karmann Ghia\\nhas no radiator.\\nThat\\'s because it\\'s air-cooled.\\nGreat. I\\'m Agent Shiftwell.\\nHolley Shiftwell from the Tokyo station.\\n- I have a message from London.\\n- Not here.\\nTry the canaps on the mezzanine.\\nThe lab boys analyzed the photo I sent?\\nWhat did they learn about the camera?\\nIt appears to be\\na standard television camera.\\nThey said if you could get closer\\nphotos next time that would be great.\\nThis was London\\'s message?\\nOh, no. No, sir.\\nThe oil platforms you were on,\\nturns out they\\'re sitting on\\nthe biggest oil reserve in the world.\\nHow did we miss that?\\nThey\\'ve scrambled\\neveryone\\'s satellites.\\nThe Americans discovered it\\njust before you did.\\nThey placed an agent on that platform\\nunder deep cover.\\nHe was able to get a photo of the car\\nwho\\'s running the entire operation.\\nGreat.\\nWho is it?\\nHas anyone seen the photo yet?\\nNope, not yet.\\nThe American is here tonight\\nto pass it to you.\\nHe\\'ll signal you when he\\'s ready.\\nGood, good.\\nOh, no.\\n- What is it?\\n- Change of plan.\\n- You\\'re meeting the American.\\n- What? Me?\\nThose thugs down there\\nwere on the oil platform.\\nIf they see me,\\nthe mission is compromised.\\nNo, I\\'m technical. I\\'m in diagnostics.\\nI\\'m... I\\'m not a field agent.\\nYou are now.\\nI\\'ll take one of them. Thank you.\\nNever know which one McQueen\\nwill have a hankering for.\\nHey. What you got here that\\'s free?\\nHow about that pistachio ice cream?\\n- No, no, wasabi.\\n- Same old same old.\\nWhat\\'s up with you?\\nThat looks delicious!\\nEr... little more, please.\\nIt is free, right?\\nKeep it coming.

Aah!\\nOh, sweet relief. Sweet relief.\\nWhatever you do,\\ndo not eat the free pistachio ice cream.\\nIt has turned.\\nSir Axlerod, I can explain.\\n- This is Mater. He\\'s...\\n- I know him.\\nThis is the bloke that called in\\nto the television show.\\n- You\\'re the one I have to thank.\\n- No, thank you.\\nThis trip\\'s been amazin\\'.\\nAh. He\\'s a little excited, isn\\'t he?\\n- Mater!\\n- But wait, I... Oh, shoot.\\n- Mater.\\n- Has anyone got a towel?\\nMater, get a hold of yourself.\\nYou\\'re making a scene!\\n- But I never leak oil.

Are you OK?\\n- I\\'m fine.\\n- Hey! Tow truck!\\nWe\\'d like to get to our private business\\nhere, if you don\\'t mind.\\nOh, yeah, sorry.\\nDon\\'t let me get in the way\\nof your private business.\\nOh, a little advice. When you hear\\na giggle and see that waterfall,\\nyou best press that green button.\\n- Thank you.\\n- It\\'s to adjust the temperature.\\n- Got it.\\n- And it\\'s in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.\\nGet out of here!\\nAll right, then.

We should find somewhere\\nmore private.\\nGee, don\\'t you think that\\'s a little?\\nYou\\'re right. Impossible to know\\nwhich areas here are compromised.\\n- So, when can I see you again?\\n- Well, let\\'s see.\\n- Tomorrow I\\'ll be out there at the races.\\n- Got it.\\nWe\\'ll rendezvous then.\\n- There you are. Where have you been?\\n- What\\'s a \"rendezvous\"?\\n- Er... It\\'s like a date.\\n- A date?\\nMater, what\\'s going on?\\nWhat\\'s going on is\\nI got me a date tomorrow.\\nGuido don\\'t believe you.\\nBelieve it.\\nMy new girlfriend just said so.\\nHey, there she is. Hey! Hey, lady!\\nSee you tomorrow!\\nGuido still don\\'t believe you.\\n- I got to admit, you tricked us real good.\\n- And we don\\'t like being tricked.\\nWhat\\'s so funny?\\nWell, I was just wearing a disguise.\\nYou guys are stuck looking like that.\\nAllinol? Thanks, fellas.\\nI hear this stuff is good for you.\\nSo you think.\\nAllinol by itself is good for you.\\nBut after microscopic examination\\nI have found\\nthat it has one small weakness.\\nWhen hit with\\nan electromagnetic pulse,\\nit becomes extremely dangerous.\\nSmile for the camera.\\nIs that all you want? I got a whole act.\\nYou were very interested in this camera\\non the oil platform.\\nNow, you will witness\\nwhat it really does.\\n- Whatever you say, Professor.\\n- You talked up a lot of cars last night.\\n- Which one\\'s your associate?\\n- Your mother.\\nOh, no, I\\'m sorry, it was your sister.\\nI can\\'t tell them apart these days.\\nCould I start it now, Professor Z?\\nGo 50% power.\\nThis camera is actually\\nan electromagnetic pulse emitter.\\nWhat about her? Did you give it to her?\\nThe allinol is now heating to a boil,\\ndramatically expanding, causing the\\nengine block to crack under the stress,\\nforcing oil\\ninto the combustion chamber.\\nHow about him? Did you talk to him?\\nWhat do I care?\\nI can replace an engine block.\\nYou may be able to,\\nbut after full impact of the pulse...\\nunfortunately...\\nthere will be nothing to replace.\\nHow about him?\\nDoes he have it?\\nThat\\'s him. He\\'s the one.\\n- Roger that, Professor Z.\\n- No!\\nYes, sir.\\nWe believe the infiltrator has passed\\nalong sensitive information.\\nI will take care of it\\nbefore any damage can be done.\\nThe project is still on schedule.\\nYou will find the second agent\\nand kill him.\\nJapan, land of the rising sun,\\nwhere ancient tradition\\nmeets modern technology.\\nWelcome to the inaugural running\\nof the World Grand Prix.\\nI\\'m Brent Mustangburger\\nwith racing legends\\nDarrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap.\\nThere\\'s never been a competition\\nlike this before.\\nFirst, allinol, making its debut tonight\\nas the required fuel\\nfor all these great champions.\\nSecond, the course itself.\\nAnd it\\'s like nothing\\nwe\\'ve ever seen before.\\nDavid, how exactly\\ndoes this competition work?\\nAll three of these street courses are\\nclassic round-the-house racetracks.\\nThis means that the LMP\\nand formula cars\\nshould break out of the gate\\nin spectacular fashion.\\nLook for Francesco Bernoulli,\\nin particular, to lead early.\\nAnd with technical turns throughout,\\nGT and touring cars,\\nlike Spain\\'s Miguel Camino,\\nshould make up ground\\nbut I doubt it\\'ll be enough\\nto stop Francesco\\nfrom absolutely running away with it.\\nWhoa now. Hold your horsepower.\\nYou forget the most important factor...\\nthat early dirt track section\\nof the course.\\nThe dirt is supposed to be\\nthe equalizer in this race.\\nFrench rally car Raoul aRoule\\nis counting on a big boost\\nthrough there.\\nAnd don\\'t forget\\nLightning McQueen.\\nHis mentor, the Hudson Hornet,\\nwas one of the greatest\\ndirt track racers of all time.\\nIn my opinion, McQueen is the best\\nall-around racer in this competition.\\nReally, Darrell, you need\\nto clean your windshield.\\nYou\\'re clearly not seeing this\\nfor what it is: Francesco\\'s race to lose.\\nIt\\'s time to find out.\\nThe racers are locking into the grid.\\nMcQUEEN: Speed. I am speed.\\nReally? You are speed?\\nThen Francesco is triple speed.\\nFrancesco is triple speed.\\nHo-ho!
